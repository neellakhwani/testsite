		<p class="intro">I am a design student by day and sleeping by night. At the age of 15, participating in an interschool tech symposium made me realise my love for design. What next? I secured wins at a lot of interschool competitions which lead to me working on my skills and growing as a person.
			<br>
			<br>
		I look for creative solutions to problems and am currently looking for opportunities that can help me learn and get to know more about the design community.</p>
